# MariTalk-Api-Demo
 
# Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation explaining how to use the MariTalk API.
MariTalk is a chatbot based on a language model that has been especially trained to understand Portuguese well.
It is able to follow instructions in a zero-shot manner, like ChatGPT. 

# Usage Example
This Google Colab contains an example showing how to use the API, which is similar to ChatGPT's API:

You will also find in the colab an example of how to use the model in a few-shot manner.

You can find more details about the API at https://chat.maritaca.ai/docs

# Technical Aspects

### Is it free?
The API is available for free to all users. We plan to introduce a paid version in the future that will offer increased throughput and reliability. 

### Rate Limit
At the moment, there is a limit of one request every 5 seconds to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to test the model. If your request is denied due to exceeding this limit, you will receive an HTTP 429 error.

### Maximum sequence length 
Currently, we support a maximum sequence length of 2000 tokens, which is equivalent to approximately 1000 words in Portuguese. We will soon support 8000 tokens.

### Throughput
It takes about 1 to 2 seconds to generate the first token given a sequence of 1000 tokens as input.
After that, new tokens are generated at a rate of 10 to 15 tokens/sec.
